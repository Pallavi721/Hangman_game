# Hangman_game
I create a Hangman game that allowed people to guess a random word from predetermined array of words. I also needed to create visuals so that players could see the man being “drawn” if they guessed wrong. In the game , players do some ‘n’ guesses and if they make a wrong one, it is decreased by one. I used “pygame in python” to code this project.
